                <p>
                My name is Greyson Dobbels. I'm a 17-year-old highschool junior with large aspirations for my future. If I had only three words to describe myself, I would say <strong>driven</strong>, <strong>ambitious</strong>, and <strong>passionate</strong>. I truly believe that with grit and desire, anything is possible.

                    <p>In tandem with a business incubator class at my highschool, I devoloped their vision of a IOS app to track food and it's expiration dates in order to achieve our large scale goal of reducing food waste.</p>
                    <p>The project is currently in development and as such is currently closed source while I secure app store approval, but the code should be available soon with or without app store acceptance.</p>
